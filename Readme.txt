Kaletam

An underconstruction genetic algorithm engine.

I believe, according to my version roadmap, that this is at v0.5, but don't quote me on it! It might be v0.6... most likely it's between the two (I left off in the middle of a cleanup - I had been hacking a lot of things together ad hoc to test out proofs of concepts within this project, instead of in supplementary classes or experimentary projects, as I usually do).

Nothing else about the project at this time. I haven't bothered with a readme until deciding I'd post this to github as example (prototype!) code.



For what it's worth I do claim my copyright here. :) If I ever get it completed to an extent that it's useful, or if I decide to abandon it, then, to the degree it *is* useful, I'm sure I'll put it under some FOSS license.
